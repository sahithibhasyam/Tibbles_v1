# Tibbles - A Timetable Management System

TIBBLES is a Timetable Generator Management System that enables educational institutions to generate and manage their class schedules efficiently. The system is designed to streamline the process of class schedule generation and management, providing administrators with tools to create, organize, and manage class schedules, assign teachers to courses, and make real-time adjustments as needed. The user-friendly interface allows the staff to access and view their schedules, as well as enter subject and time preferences. The system's optimized timetable generation process helps to mitigate scheduling clashes and ensure an ideal timetable. The database management system also enables the efficient storage, retrieval, and management of class schedule data, including class times, subjects, teachers, and more. Additionally, the system offers robust reporting capabilities to meet the diverse needs of the institution.

## Technology Stack

This project utilizes the following technology stack:

#### MySQL Database
To store and manage the vast amounts of data required for scheduling and organizing class schedules, we have utilized the powerful and reliable MySQL Database. This database management system provides robust data storage and retrieval capabilities, making it an ideal choice for this project.

#### Django Web Framework
The Django Web Framework is an open-source framework for building high-performance, secure, and scalable web applications. Its modular design and built-in functionality make it the perfect choice for building TIBBLES, which requires a web-based interface for administrators to manage class schedules and for users to view their schedules.

#### HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. The front-end user interface of TIBBLES has been developed using HTML to provide a structured and well-organized user experience.

#### CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to add style and visual enhancements to the HTML-based user interface. This technology has been used in TIBBLES to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that makes it easy for administrators and users to interact with the system.

## Future Scope and Enhancement

The future scope and enhancement of this project could include several possibilities such as:
1.	Integration with other systems such as student information systems, room booking systems, and calendar systems to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the timetable generation process.
2.	Developing a user-friendly interface and mobile app to make it easier for faculty and students to access and manage their schedules.
3.	Incorporating machine learning algorithms to optimize the timetable based on factors such as student enrollment, class size, and historical data.
4.	Adding features such as automatic conflict detection and resolution, and the ability to schedule recurring events.
5.	Enabling the system to generate different types of schedules, such as schedules for exams, labs, and special events.
6.	Allowing multiple stakeholders, such as department heads, to collaborate and approve the final schedule.
7.	Incorporating real-time updates and notifications to keep users informed of any schedule changes or conflicts.
8.	Developing robust reporting and analytics capabilities to give administrators insight into how the timetable is being used and identify opportunities for improvement.
